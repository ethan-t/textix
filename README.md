# textix

Textix is a very simple Gtk3 text editor written in Python 3. It features Python syntax highlighting, line numbering, and searching. Textix has no comments, because I am a bad programmer. The code makes liberal use of code found [here](https://github.com/sebp/PyGObject-Tutorial). A simpler, cleaned up version of the Congressional App Challenge submission of the author.
